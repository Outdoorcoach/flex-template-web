[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/sharetribe/flex-template-web.svg?style=svg&circle-token=198451e83e5cecb0d662949260dbc3273ac44a67)](https://circleci.com/gh/sharetribe/flex-template-web)

This is a template web application for a Sharetribe Flex marketplace ready to be extended and
customized. It is based on an application bootstrapped with
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with some additions,
namely server side rendering and a custom CSS setup.

## Quick start

If you just want to get the app running quickly to test it out, first install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and follow along:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Outdoorcoach/flex-template-web.git # clone this repository
cd flex-template-web/                                           # change to the cloned directory
npm install                                                    # install dependencies
npm run config                                                 # add the mandatory env vars to your local config
npm run dev                                                    # start the dev server, this will open a browser in localhost:3000
```
